ATTRIBUTES

    All the attributes of Perinci::CmdLine::Base, plus:

 log => BOOL (default: 1)

    Whether to load Log::Any::App (enable logging output) by default. See
    "LOGGING" for more details.

 use_utf8 => BOOL

    From Term::App::Role::Attrs (please see its docs for more details).
    There are several other attributes added by the role.

 undo => BOOL (optional, default 0)

    Whether to enable undo/redo functionality. Some things to note if you
    intend to use undo:

      * These common command-line options will be recognized

      --undo, --redo, --history, --clear-history.

      * Transactions will be used

      use_tx=>1 will be passed to Perinci::Access, which will cause it to
      initialize the transaction manager. Riap requests begin_tx and
      commit_tx will enclose the call request to function.

      * Called function will need to support transaction and undo

      Function which does not meet qualifications will refuse to be called.

      Exception is when subcommand is specified with undo=>0, where
      transaction will not be used for that subcommand. For an example of
      disabling transaction for some subcommands, see bin/u-trash in the
      distribution.

 undo_dir => STR (optional, default ~/.<program_name>/.undo)

    Where to put undo data. This is actually the transaction manager's data
    dir.
