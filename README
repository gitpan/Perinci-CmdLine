VERSION
    This document describes version 1.41 of Perinci::CmdLine (from Perl

SYNOPSIS
    See Perinci::CmdLine::Manual::Examples.

DESCRIPTION
    See Perinci::CmdLine::Manual.

    Screenshots:

REQUEST KEYS
    See also Perinci::CmdLine::Base. Extra stuffs put by this module to the
    $r hash/stash.

    *   format_options => hash

ATTRIBUTES
    All the attributes of Perinci::CmdLine::Base, plus:

  log => BOOL (default: 1)
    Whether to load Log::Any::App (enable logging output) by default. See
    "LOGGING" for more details.

  use_utf8 => BOOL
    From Term::App::Role::Attrs (please see its docs for more details).
    There are several other attributes added by the role.

  undo => BOOL (optional, default 0)
    Whether to enable undo/redo functionality. Some things to note if you
    intend to use undo:

    *   These common command-line options will be recognized

        "--undo", "--redo", "--history", "--clear-history".

    *   Transactions will be used

        "use_tx=>1" will be passed to Perinci::Access, which will cause it
        to initialize the transaction manager. Riap requests begin_tx and
        commit_tx will enclose the call request to function.

    *   Called function will need to support transaction and undo

        Function which does not meet qualifications will refuse to be
        called.

        Exception is when subcommand is specified with "undo=>0", where
        transaction will not be used for that subcommand. For an example of
        disabling transaction for some subcommands, see "bin/u-trash" in the
        distribution.

  undo_dir => STR (optional, default ~/.<program_name>/.undo)
    Where to put undo data. This is actually the transaction manager's data
    dir.

METHODS
    All the methods of Perinci::CmdLine::Base, plus:

RESULT METADATA
    All those supported by Perinci::CmdLine::Base, plus:

  x.hint.result_binary => bool
    If set to true, then when formatting to "text" formats, this class won't
    print any newline to keep the data being printed unmodified.

ENVIRONMENT

    plus:
