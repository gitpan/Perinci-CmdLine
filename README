NAME
    Perinci::CmdLine - Rinci/Riap-based command-line application framework

VERSION
    This document describes version 1.28 of Perinci::CmdLine (from Perl
    distribution Perinci-CmdLine), released on 2014-09-04.

SYNOPSIS
    See Perinci::CmdLine::Manual::Examples.

DESCRIPTION
    See Perinci::CmdLine::Manual.

REQUEST KEYS
    See also Perinci::CmdLine::Base. Extra stuffs put by this module to the
    $r hash/stash.

    *   format_options => hash

ATTRIBUTES
    All the attributes of Perinci::CmdLine::Base, plus:

  log_any_app => BOOL (default: 1)
    Whether to load Log::Any::App (enable logging output) by default. See
    "LOGGING" for more details.

  use_utf8 => BOOL
    From SHARYANTO::Role::TermAttrs (please see its docs for more details).
    There are several other attributes added by the role.

  undo => BOOL (optional, default 0)
    Whether to enable undo/redo functionality. Some things to note if you
    intend to use undo:

    *   These common command-line options will be recognized

        "--undo", "--redo", "--history", "--clear-history".

    *   Transactions will be used

        "use_tx=>1" will be passed to Perinci::Access, which will cause it
        to initialize the transaction manager. Riap requests begin_tx and
        commit_tx will enclose the call request to function.

    *   Called function will need to support transaction and undo

        Function which does not meet qualifications will refuse to be
        called.

        Exception is when subcommand is specified with "undo=>0", where
        transaction will not be used for that subcommand. For an example of
        disabling transaction for some subcommands, see "bin/u-trash" in the
        distribution.

  undo_dir => STR (optional, default ~/.<program_name>/.undo)
    Where to put undo data. This is actually the transaction manager's data
    dir.

METHODS
    All the methods of Perinci::CmdLine::Base, plus:

RESULT METADATA
    All those supported by Perinci::CmdLine::Base, plus:

  property: is_stream => BOOL
    XXX should perhaps be defined as standard in Rinci::function.

    If set to 1, signify that result is a stream. Result must be a glob, or
    an object that responds to getline() and eof() (like a Perl IO::Handle
    object), or an array/tied array. Format must currently be "text"
    (streaming YAML might be supported in the future). Items of result will
    be displayed to output as soon as it is retrieved, and unlike
    non-streams, it can be infinite.

    An example function:

     $SPEC{cat_file} = { ... };
     sub cat_file {
         my %args = @_;
         open my($fh), "<", $args{path} or return [500, "Can't open file: $!"];
         [200, "OK", $fh, {is_stream=>1}];
     }

    another example:

     use Tie::Simple;
     $SPEC{uc_file} = { ... };
     sub uc_file {
         my %args = @_;
         open my($fh), "<", $args{path} or return [500, "Can't open file: $!"];
         my @ary;
         tie @ary, "Tie::Simple", undef,
             SHIFT     => sub { eof($fh) ? undef : uc(~~<$fh> // "") },
             FETCHSIZE => sub { eof($fh) ? 0 : 1 };
         [200, "OK", \@ary, {is_stream=>1}];
     }

    See also Data::Unixish and App::dux which deals with streams.

  attribute: cmdline.page_result => BOOL
    If you want to filter the result through pager (currently defaults to
    $ENV{PAGER} or "less -FRSX"), you can set "cmdline.page_result" in
    result metadata to true.

    For example:

     $SPEC{doc} = { ... };
     sub doc {
         ...
         [200, "OK", $doc, {"cmdline.page_result"=>1}];
     }

  attribute: cmdline.pager => STR
    Instruct Perinci::CmdLine to use specified pager instead of $ENV{PAGER}
    or the default "less" or "more".

ENVIRONMENT
    All the environment variables that Perinci::CmdLine::Base supports,
    plus:

  PERINCI_CMDLINE_COLOR_THEME => STR
    Can be used to set "color_theme".

  PROGRESS => BOOL
    Explicitly turn the progress bar on/off.

  PAGER => STR
    Like in other programs, can be set to select the pager program (when
    "cmdline.page_result" result metadata is active). Can also be set to ''
    or 0 to explicitly disable paging even though "cmd.page_result" result
    metadata is active.

  COLOR => INT
    Please see SHARYANTO::Role::TermAttrs.

  UTF8 => BOOL
    Please see SHARYANTO::Role::TermAttrs.
